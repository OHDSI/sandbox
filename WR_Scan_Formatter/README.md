# Excel Macros to Format White Rabbit Scan Report #
The goal is to make it easier to navigate large White Rabbit Scan Reports

- Format each sheet, expanding column size
- Change the Column Heading 'Frequency' to 'Freq' to take up less space
- Create links from Table name to Table in Field Overview sheet
- Create links from each column name in the Field Overview sheet to the Field column in the table detail sheet

## Precondition ##
The White Rabbit Scan workbook has Excel worksheets labeled 'Table Overview' and 'Field Overview'.  I don't know when WR started using these names for the worksheets, but I do not see them in earlier scan reports I have.  These macros were tested on scan reports generated by WhiteRabbit v0.10.1.

## Installation ##
Get to Excel Developer application and paste code into ThisWorkBook.  Another option is to save as an add-in so that the code will be accessible to other scan report workbooks.

## Dis-claimer ##
I wrote this for my benefit, but thought it might be useful to other that have White Rabbit scan reports with lots of tables and fields.  Feel free to make improvements and push them back into the OHDSI sandbox.
